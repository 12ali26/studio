## 🐛 **Known Issues**

### Non-Critical Issues
- ESLint setup not configured (doesn't affect functionality)
- Mock AI responses (will be replaced with real AI APIs in production)
- Local storage for data persistence (would use real database in production)

### Future Enhancements Needed
- Real AI API integration (OpenRouter/Gemini)
- Database persistence instead of localStorage
- Real-time WebSocket upgrades for multi-user collaboration
- Stripe integration for real payments
- Email notifications for budget alerts

## 🚀 **Production Readiness**

### Ready for Production
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- ✅ Build process successful
- ✅ Component architecture solid
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Performance optimized (35s build time)

### Next Steps for Production
1. **Re-enable Authentication**: Uncomment auth code in `src/app/page.tsx`
2. **Add Real AI APIs**: Replace mock responses with OpenRouter/Gemini calls
3. **Database Integration**: Replace localStorage with PostgreSQL/Firebase
4. **Payment Processing**: Add Stripe integration for real billing
5. **Email Services**: Add SendGrid/AWS SES for notifications
